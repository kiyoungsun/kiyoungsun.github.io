I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [KAIST GNSS Lab](https://gnss.kaist.ac.kr) supervised by [Prof. Jiyun Lee](https://gnss.kaist.ac.kr/?page_id=71), completing my dissertation in August 2025. I will continue as a Postdoctoral Researcher in KAIST supported by the Jang Young Sil Fellow Program.

**My research interests:**
* **Ionospheric dynamics**:
 studying plasma structures and their physical processes
* **Scintillation modeling**: developing physics-based simulation models
* **Navigation Integrity**: assessing scintillation effects on safety-critical applications such as Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS)

My doctoral dissertation, **GBAS Integrity under Ionospheric Scintillation: Error Characterization, Modeling, and Performance Evaluation**, develops comprehensive integrity frameworks addressing critical safety requirements for aviation navigation systems under ionospheric scintillation.

I was a visiting researcher at [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en/kn) in 2016, [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/internships/apply/jpl-visiting-student-research-program) (2020-2021), and [SeNSe Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://gnssrange.com) supervised by [Prof. Jade Morton](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/jade-morton) in 2023.
